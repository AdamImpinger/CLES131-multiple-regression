# Data for "Extreme drought impacts have been underestimated in grasslands and shrublands globally"

## Description of the data and file structure

The structure of this repository is relatively simple, with one single R script (Dryad_submission.R) which uses data from seven .csv files in order to reproduce results and figures from the publication. The datasets can all be linked by the site_code column which is the unique identifier for each of the 100 sites in the study.

Dryad_data_site_info.csv

This file includes information for the sites in the Drought Network International Drought Experiment including the full name, continent, country, habitat type, mean annual precipitation, and aridity index values.



**dt3.all.csv & drt3.120**

Contains information as to the mean drought response at each site (mean_DS3), number of replicates at each site (n), standard deviation of response (sd), standard error of response (se), lower and upper bounds of 95% confidence interval, and whether the site was significantly different from zero.

**Dryad_submission_datappt_cv2.csv**

Includes dt3.all plus the interannual precipitation variability (cv_ppt_inter)

**Dryad_submission_datappt_rich2.csv**

Includes dt3.all plus the average richness at each site

**drt.ave.csv**

Includes drought severity (drtpct_map), number of treatment days, and response (mean_DS3)

**ds.map.csv**

Plot level precipitation values

**Dryad_submission_gram.ave.csv**

Includes the proportion of vegetative cover from graminoids at each site

**Dryad_submission_datapptsand2.csv**

Includes dt3.all plus the average sand content for each site

**Dryad_data_site_info.csv**

Includes information about continent, country, mean annual precipitation (precip), and aridity (arid) for each site

**datapptgram1.csv**

Plot level percent graminoid

**climdat2.csv**

Includes mean annual precipitation (precip) and mean annual temperature (temp) for each site

**datappt_pryr.csv**

Includes dt3.all plus the drought severity of the prior year (drtpct_map730)

**datappt_MAP2.csv**

Includes dt3.all plus mean annual precipitation (precip)

**datappt_ai3.csv**

Includes dt3.all plus the log of the aridity index (logAI)

**data.mean1.csv & data.hab.csv**

Same variables as defined in dt3.all
